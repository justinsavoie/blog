      <description>Recently, for an assignment, I had to answer the following question: &amp;ldquo;Duverger&amp;rsquo;s Law contends that Single Member Plurality systems produce two party systems dominated by a competition for centrist voters. What are the assumptions behind this argument? How can we explain the main exceptions to this law in the Canadian context?&amp;rdquo;
This is a timely issue. The federal election is coming up at the end of this year, and between 3 and 5 (6 in Quebec?</description>
