      <description>Recently, for an assignment, I had to answer the following question: &amp;ldquo;Duverger&amp;rsquo;s Law contends that Single Member Plurality systems produce two party systems dominated by a competition for centrist voters. What are the assumptions behind this argument? How can we explain the main exceptions to this law in the Canadian context?&amp;rdquo;
This is a timely issue. The federal election is coming up at the end of this year, and between 3 and 5 (6 in Quebec?</description>

      <description>Welcome! I&amp;rsquo;m Justin Savoie, a student of political science, programmer, data scientist and somewhat dilettante philosophy enthusiast.
This will at some point become my personal website. Right now, it&amp;rsquo;s simply a place where I can share thoughts.
The theme was forked from @jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme and modified by Yihui Xie.</description>
