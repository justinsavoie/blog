Welcome! I'm Justin Savoie, a student of political science, programmer, data scientist and somewhat dilettante philosophy enthusiast. 

This will at some point become my personal website. Right now, it's simply a place where I can share thoughts.

The theme was forked from [@jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme](https://github.com/jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme) and modified by [Yihui Xie](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-lithium).
